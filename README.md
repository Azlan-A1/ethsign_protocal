# Sign_Protocal
Scaling Ethereum 2024 Project using SignETH Protocal.

This project explores the security implications amongst programs that utlize signing protocals. Similar to DocuSign, EthSign is used to sign away transactions, being able to interact and analyze the past history that has been discovered within a document. 

Ideas: 

Developing a Job Board that demonsrates when a candidate is hired, the employer will send an EthSign relied document that would request the potential candidate to sign the document using EthSign. 

Packagaes/Dependencies and concepts utilized: 

Nextjs
Python
Ethereum 

Ethereum
DocuSign

Use cases for EthSign: 
Used for international jurisdictions, signing contracts amongst governmental organizations overseas. 


Alternative Idea: Developing a bug bounty program which instantly awards its users with the smart contract provided by EthSign. If the user has solved a valid threathening bug that a product of a company has launched, then the user is awarded with the funds in cryptocurrency which then could be processed for the currency of their choosing that is finally depositied into their bank account. 

As EthSign helps solves crossborder collaboration, people who live in countries overseas from where the company within the bug bounty program is stationed, using cryptocurrency solves that as it's Web3 based and is transferred amongst it's own "currency". 

Additional Measures to take place: 

Use a real world example of a bug bounty that has been solved and I can use that to execute how the contract would work with that.





































This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
